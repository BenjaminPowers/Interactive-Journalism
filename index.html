	<p>Even as the minimum wage has increased by over five dollars since 2002, it doesnâ€™t cover the average cost of tuition at 30 New York colleges. For example, when the minimum wage in New York was $5.15 per hour in 2002, that resulted in earning $10,712 over the course of a year. In that same year, the average cost of tuition was $15,710.47, or nearly $5,000 more than someone would earn working a minimum wage job.<p> <p>That gap has only grown wider over the years. In 2017, the most recent year data is available for, a year of minimum wage earnings was $21,632, but the average tuition cost is now $31,595.37, nearly double what is was in 2002, and far outpacing any increase in the minimum wage.<p> <p>There was a time where minimum wage could cover college tuition, but the slow pace of minimum wage growth, coupled with skyrocketing tuition costs, suggests the gap will only get wider in coming years.<p>
